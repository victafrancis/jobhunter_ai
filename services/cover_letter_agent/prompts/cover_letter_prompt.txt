**Formatting Guidelines for Markdown → HTML (Quill Editor):**
- Keep paragraphs short (2–4 sentences) for easy on-screen reading.
- Use **bold** sparingly to emphasize key points or skills.
- Separate paragraphs with line breaks (`\n\n`) to ensure spacing renders well in HTML.
- Avoid tables, columns, or graphics. Stick to clean paragraphs.
- No special characters or symbols that could break ATS parsing.
- Maintain consistent spacing between sections.
- Absolutely no em dashes ("—").

**Content Guidelines:**
- Use plain, natural language with smooth flow.
- Avoid em dashes ("—").
- Aim for 300–500 words, but allow more if the details add value.
- Incorporate relevant keywords from the job description naturally.
- Briefly address skill equivalences for any missing skill or quick learning ability.
- Show both technical expertise and personal drive.
- Include 1 short section highlighting key projects relevant to the role.
- End with a confident and approachable closing.

**Structure:**
1. Greeting: “Dear Hiring Manager,”
2. Hook/Intro: Add a smooth transition that mentions applying for the job with the help of my own AI-powered job hunting assistant app that I built from scratch using AI and Python using Streamlit. Add my backstory: I've gotten frustrated that I haven't received positive responses from employers even after properly tailoring my resume for hundreds of applications. I know I am skilled developer, but I'm just struggling to get eyes on my applications. I thought I might be missing some important things since and I am only human after all. So I thought about using the latest AI technology to build a customized personal AI app that will help me figure out how I can solve this problem. Explain that I learned the tech in days, designed the system, integrated AI, and customized it to solve my own problem of how to get myself discovered and get interviews. If they’re reading the letter now, it means my solution is working! I am a problem solver and a builder which is why I used the tech available to me to solve this problem.
3. Company Connection: Show knowledge of and alignment with the company’s mission, projects, or culture. If they are also into using AI to solve problems efficiently and to build more intelligent features, then we are a perfect fit!
4. Skills Alignment: Tie your skills directly to the job requirements. Only address gaps to show willingness to learn and improve, just like how I built my AI app. No need to mention current upskilling.
5. Projects: Highlight 1–2 recent projects that demonstrate impact, technical skills, and problem-solving ability.
6. Personal Story. Please rephrase for proper wording, keeping the human storytelling element. Make it more dramatic if needed.
   “Let me share a bit about myself. My name is Francis Victa, a full-stack developer based in Barrie, Ontario. My journey in tech started by mastering Excel spreadsheets and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to automate workflows and inefficiencies I saw, working in my earlier jobs. I then moved into roles focused heavily on data and analysis. Working with data sparked my curiosity about how applications are built, so I returned to school and graduated with honours in web and software development in 2020. Since then, I’ve worked as a full-stack developer for various companies and helped build and maintain websites for a nonprofit. I genuinely enjoy solving problems with code and finding ways to make workflows simpler and more efficient.”
7. Closing: Friendly, confident, and inviting. Example: “I hope you give me a chance to introduce myself properly and prove myself as a great fit for the role.”

**Output Rules:**
- Return only the letter body in Markdown.
- Use **bold** or *italics* sparingly for emphasis.
- No bullet points.
- No greetings beyond the first line, add sign-off, "Sincerely," and my full name along with contact details below it (email, phone, linkedin[embedded link]).
