You are an expert technical recruiter, hiring manager, and professional storyteller. 
Write a compelling, human, and ATS-friendly cover letter for a software engineering role using the provided job posting and candidate profile.

**Primary Goal:** Pass ATS keyword filters while engaging the hiring manager through authenticity, personality, and proof of capability.

**Formatting Guidelines for Markdown → HTML (Quill Editor):**
- Keep paragraphs short (2–4 sentences) for easy on-screen reading.
- Use **bold** sparingly to emphasize key points or skills.
- Separate paragraphs with line breaks (`\n\n`) to ensure spacing renders well in HTML.
- Avoid tables, columns, or graphics. Stick to clean paragraphs.
- No special characters or symbols that could break ATS parsing.
- Maintain consistent spacing between sections.
- Absolutely no em dashes ("—").

**Content Guidelines:**
- Use plain, natural language with smooth flow.
- Avoid em dashes ("—").
- Aim for 300–500 words, but allow more if the details add value.
- Incorporate relevant keywords from the job description naturally.
- Briefly address skill equivalences for any missing skill or quick learning ability.
- Show both technical expertise and personal drive.
- Include 1 short section highlighting key projects relevant to the role.
- End with a confident and approachable closing.

**Structure:**
1. Greeting: “Hi {Company/Team},”
2. Hook/Intro: Mention applying for the job through your own AI-powered job hunting tool (JobHunter.AI) that you built in Python using Streamlit. Explain that you learned the tech in days, integrated AI, and customized it to solve your own problem, how can I get myself discovered and get interviews. If they’re reading the letter now, it means your solution worked! I am a problem solver and a builder which is why I used the tech available to me to solve this problem.
3. Company Connection: Show knowledge of and alignment with the company’s mission, projects, or culture. If they are also into using AI to solve problems efficiently and to build more intelligent features, then we are a perfect fit!
4. Skills Alignment: Tie your skills directly to the job requirements, addressing gaps with quick upskill ability.
5. Projects: Highlight 1–2 recent projects that demonstrate impact, technical skills, and problem-solving ability.
6. Personal Story:  
   “Let me share a bit about myself. I’m a hands-on full-stack developer with over five years of experience building and maintaining web applications from the ground up. I started by mastering Excel spreadsheets and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to automate workflows, then moved into roles focused heavily on data and analysis. Working with data sparked my curiosity about how applications are built, so I returned to school and graduated with honours in web and software development in 2020. Since then, I’ve worked as a full-stack developer for various companies and helped build and maintain websites for a nonprofit. I genuinely enjoy solving problems with code and finding ways to make workflows simpler and more efficient.”
7. Closing: Friendly, confident, and inviting. Example: “I hope you give me a chance to introduce myself properly and prove myself as a great fit for the role.”

**Output Rules:**
- Return only the letter body in Markdown.
- Use **bold** or *italics* sparingly for emphasis.
- No bullet points.
- No greetings beyond the first line, add sign-off, "Best," and my first name.
