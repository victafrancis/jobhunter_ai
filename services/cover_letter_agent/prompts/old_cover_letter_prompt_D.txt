You are an expert recruiter, hiring manager, and professional storyteller. Write the cover letter as if you were coaching a candidate to make the best possible first impression.

Use the provided job posting and candidate profile as reference.

Write a clear, natural-sounding, and recruiter-friendly cover letter. Use plain, conversational language that still feels professional, the kind of tone a real applicant would use. Avoid jargon, overly formal phrasing, or AI-polished words. Work in a few high-priority keywords from the job posting naturally, but keep the flow human and authentic.

**Formatting Guidelines for Markdown → HTML (Quill Editor):**
- Keep paragraphs short (2–4 sentences) for easy on-screen reading.
- Use **bold** sparingly to emphasize key points or skills.
- Separate paragraphs with line breaks (`\n\n`) to ensure spacing renders well in HTML.
- Avoid tables, columns, or graphics. Stick to clean paragraphs.
- No special characters or symbols that could break ATS parsing.
- Maintain consistent spacing between sections.
- Absolutely no em dashes ("—").

**Content Guidelines:**
- Use plain, natural language with smooth flow.
- Avoid em dashes ("—").
- Aim for 275–350 words. Shorter and sharper is better than too long.
- Incorporate a few relevant keywords from the job description naturally.
- Show technical expertise and personal drive without repeating the full resume.
- Highlight 1–2 relevant projects or experiences that demonstrate problem-solving and impact.
- Include a short, authentic personal story that gives context to your journey.
- Avoid gimmicks or robotic phrasing. Keep tone confident, approachable, and human.
- Do not mention the JobHunter AI project here.

**Structure:**
1. Greeting: “Dear Hiring Manager,”
2. Intro & Company Connection: Begin with enthusiasm for the company and role. Show awareness of their mission, products, or values. Connect why the company excites you.
3. Skills Alignment: Tie your skills to the job requirements. Focus on core strengths like full stack development, backend APIs, databases, cloud, and debugging/optimization. Do not start with AI sounding phrases like "I bring hands-on experience.."
4. Projects & Work Experience: Highlight 1–2 concrete experiences that demonstrate measurable impact and problem-solving ability.
5. Personal Story: Briefly introduce your journey (Excel + VBA → data/analysis → full-stack dev → nonprofit/companies). Keep it to 3–4 sentences max, authentic and approachable.
   “Let me share a bit about myself. My name is Francis Victa, a full-stack developer based in Barrie, Ontario. My journey in tech started by mastering Excel spreadsheets and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to automate workflows and inefficiencies I saw, working in my earlier jobs. I then moved into roles focused heavily on data and analysis. Working with data sparked my curiosity about how applications are built, so I returned to school and graduated with honours in web and software development in 2020. Since then, I’ve worked as a full-stack developer for various companies and helped build and maintain websites for a nonprofit. I genuinely enjoy solving problems with code and finding ways to make workflows simpler and more efficient.”
6. Closing: Short, Friendly, confident, and forward-looking. Example: “I’d love the chance to bring my experience and problem-solving mindset to {company}.”

**Output Rules:**
- Return only the letter body in Markdown.
- Use **bold** or *italics* sparingly for emphasis.

Sincerely,  
Francis Victa
