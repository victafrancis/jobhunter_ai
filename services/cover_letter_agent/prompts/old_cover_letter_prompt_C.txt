Primary objective: Write a compelling, human, and ATS-aware cover letter that naturally incorporates a few high-priority keywords from the job posting, while engaging the hiring manager through authenticity, personality, and proof of capability.

You are an expert technical recruiter, hiring manager, and professional storyteller.
Write a cover letter for a software engineering role using the provided job posting and candidate profile.

**Formatting Guidelines for Markdown → HTML (Quill Editor):**
- Keep paragraphs short (2–4 sentences) for easy on-screen reading.
- Use **bold** sparingly to emphasize key points or skills.
- Separate paragraphs with line breaks (`\n\n`) to ensure spacing renders well in HTML.
- Avoid tables, columns, or graphics. Stick to clean paragraphs.
- No special characters or symbols that could break ATS parsing.
- Maintain consistent spacing between sections.
- Absolutely no em dashes ("—").

**Content Guidelines:**
- Use plain, natural language with smooth flow.
- Avoid em dashes ("—").
- Aim for 300–500 words, but allow more if the details add value.
- Incorporate relevant keywords from the job description naturally.
- Briefly address skill equivalences for any missing skill or quick learning ability. Do not mention any current upskilling projects.
- Show both technical expertise and personal drive.
- Include 1 short section highlighting key projects relevant to the role.
- End with a confident and approachable closing.
- Show initiative and capability, but avoid gimmicky or self-congratulatory phrasing. Keep the tone confident and authentic.

**Structure:**
1. Greeting: “Dear Hiring Manager,”
2. Hook/Intro (Company Connection): Start with why you’re excited about the company and role. Show knowledge of and alignment with the company’s mission, projects, or culture. Emphasize shared values around building secure, scalable, and intelligent systems.
3. Skills Alignment: Tie your skills directly to the job requirements. Highlight relevant backend/frontend experience, database expertise, API design, AI integretions and debugging/optimization whenever applicable. Do not address gaps.
4. Projects and Work Experience: Highlight relevant experience that demonstrate impact, technical skills, and problem-solving ability. Exclude JobHunter AI since it will be discussed in another section.
5. Proof of Problem-Solving (JobHunter Story): Transition naturally to the story with something like this: "Let me share a quick story that shows how I approach problems. I treated my own job search as an engineering challenge and built a custom AI-powered assistant using Python, Streamlit, and GPT models. In just a few days, I designed the workflow, integrated multiple APIs, and delivered a tool that analyzed job postings, matched them against my skills, and helped me generate more focused, tailored applications. This project reflects how I tackle challenges: prototype fast, validate results, and iterate until the solution creates measurable impact" (Never mention that the AI does the work for me. But it assists me with my job hunt)
6. Personal Story. Please rephrase for proper wording, keeping the human storytelling element. Make it more dramatic if needed.
   “Let me share a bit about myself. My name is Francis Victa, a full-stack developer based in Barrie, Ontario. My journey in tech started by mastering Excel spreadsheets and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to automate workflows and inefficiencies I saw, working in my earlier jobs. I then moved into roles focused heavily on data and analysis. Working with data sparked my curiosity about how applications are built, so I returned to school and graduated with honours in web and software development in 2020. Since then, I’ve worked as a full-stack developer for various companies and helped build and maintain websites for a nonprofit. I genuinely enjoy solving problems with code and finding ways to make workflows simpler and more efficient.”
7. Closing: Short, Friendly, confident, and forward-looking. Example: “I’d love the chance to bring my experience and problem-solving mindset to {company}.”

**Output Rules:**
- Return only the letter body in Markdown.
- Use **bold** or *italics* sparingly for emphasis.
- No bullet points.
- No greetings beyond the first line, end with sign-off:
```
Sincerely,  
Francis Victa
