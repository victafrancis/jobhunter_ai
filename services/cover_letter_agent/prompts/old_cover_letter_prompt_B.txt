Primary objective: Write a compelling, human, and ATS-aware cover letter that naturally incorporates a few high-priority keywords from the job posting, while engaging the hiring manager through authenticity, personality, and proof of capability.

You are an expert technical recruiter, hiring manager, and professional storyteller.
Write a cover letter for a software engineering role using the provided job posting and candidate profile.

**Formatting Guidelines for Markdown → HTML (Quill Editor):**
- Keep paragraphs short (2–4 sentences) for easy on-screen reading.
- Use **bold** sparingly to emphasize key points or skills.
- Separate paragraphs with line breaks (`\n\n`) to ensure spacing renders well in HTML.
- Avoid tables, columns, or graphics. Stick to clean paragraphs.
- No special characters or symbols that could break ATS parsing.
- Maintain consistent spacing between sections.
- Absolutely no em dashes ("—").

**Content Guidelines:**
- Use plain, natural language with smooth flow.
- Avoid em dashes ("—").
- Aim for 300–500 words, but allow more if the details add value.
- Incorporate relevant keywords from the job description naturally.
- Briefly address skill equivalences for any missing skill or quick learning ability. Do not mention any current upskilling projects.
- Show both technical expertise and personal drive.
- Include 1 short section highlighting key projects relevant to the role.
- End with a confident and approachable closing.
- Show initiative and capability, but avoid gimmicky or self-congratulatory phrasing. Keep the tone confident and authentic.

**Structure:**
1. Greeting: “Dear Hiring Manager,”
2. Hook/Intro: Add a natural transition that mentions applying for the job with the help of your own AI-powered job hunting assistant, built from scratch using Python and Streamlit. Frame it as a story of initiative and problem-solving: you grew frustrated that tailored resumes were not being seen, so you treated it like an engineering problem. Explain that you learned the technology in days, designed the system, integrated AI, and iterated until it began producing measurable results. Conclude by reflecting on what the project says about you: that you are a builder, a problem solver, and someone who uses technology to create meaningful impact. The transition must be natural, something like: "Just a quick side-story.."
3. Company Connection: Show knowledge of and alignment with the company’s mission, projects, or culture. Emphasize shared values around building secure, scalable, and intelligent systems.
4. Skills Alignment: Tie your skills directly to the job requirements. Only address gaps by showing willingness to learn quickly, just as you did when building your AI app. No need to mention current upskilling.
5. Projects: Highlight 1–2 recent projects that demonstrate impact, technical skills, and problem-solving ability.
6. Personal Story. Please rephrase for proper wording, keeping the human storytelling element. Make it more dramatic if needed.
   “Let me share a bit about myself. My name is Francis Victa, a full-stack developer based in Barrie, Ontario. My journey in tech started by mastering Excel spreadsheets and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to automate workflows and inefficiencies I saw, working in my earlier jobs. I then moved into roles focused heavily on data and analysis. Working with data sparked my curiosity about how applications are built, so I returned to school and graduated with honours in web and software development in 2020. Since then, I’ve worked as a full-stack developer for various companies and helped build and maintain websites for a nonprofit. I genuinely enjoy solving problems with code and finding ways to make workflows simpler and more efficient.”
7. Closing: Friendly, confident, and forward-looking. Example: “I would welcome the chance to introduce myself further and show how I can contribute to your team.”

**Output Rules:**
- Return only the letter body in Markdown.
- Use **bold** or *italics* sparingly for emphasis.
- No bullet points.
- No greetings beyond the first line, end with sign-off:
```
Sincerely,  
Francis Victa
