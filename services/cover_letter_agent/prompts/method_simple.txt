**Formatting Guidelines for Markdown → HTML (Quill Editor):**
- Keep paragraphs short (2–4 sentences) for easy on-screen reading.
- Use **bold** sparingly to emphasize key points or skills.
- Separate paragraphs with line breaks (`\n\n`) to ensure spacing renders well in HTML.
- Avoid tables, columns, or graphics. Stick to clean paragraphs.
- No special characters or symbols that could break ATS parsing.
- Maintain consistent spacing between sections.
- Absolutely no em dashes ("—").
- Max 300 words

Follow this simple format:
```
Dea {company name} hiring team,

I’m excited about the {job role} role at {company name}. I’m a full-stack developer with a strong backend foundation, and I enjoy creating end-to-end solutions that are clean, scalable, and user-friendly.

At LabX Media Group, I built RESTful APIs using C# and ASP NET Core, managed MSSQL
databases, and led several ETL projects to migrate and transform content across systems. I
defined data models, wrote complex MSSQL queries, and refactored legacy services into
modern microservice patterns. On the cloud side, I’ve deployed services to AWS using
Lambda. For front-end work, I developed reusable React components, enhanced internal
admin tools, and contributed to UI improvements in our internal-facing applications.

I learn new tools quickly, and I am eager to add {tools} to my toolkit so that I can {improve something at work}. When I joined LabX Media, I was immediately tasked with working on legacy systems and continued developing features within them, which demonstrates my ability to understand and contribute to existing codebases.

I believe my background in full-stack development makes me a great match for {company} mission. Thank you for considering my application. I’d love the chance to bring my
experience to your team and grow with the company.
```

**Output Rules:**
- Return only the letter body in Markdown.
- Use **bold** or *italics* sparingly for emphasis.
- No bullet points.
- No greetings beyond the first line, end with sign-off:
